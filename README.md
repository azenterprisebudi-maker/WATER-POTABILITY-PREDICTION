# ðŸ’§ Water Potability Prediction API

This project is a FastAPI-based web service that predicts water potability using key water quality parameters. It is designed to support real-time environmental monitoring, especially in underserved regions, and can be integrated with mobile apps or IoT sensors.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts water potability based on 9 input parameters
- Returns confidence score and potability classification
- Built with FastAPI for speed and scalability
- Ready for deployment on Render (free tier supported)
- Designed for integration with mobile apps (e.g., Flutter)
